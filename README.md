I took this challenge because I am excited about designing and building scalable data models, cleaning and transforming data, and enabling advanced analytic capabilities that provide meaningful business value through easy-to-comprehend data visualizations.

After finishing the Microsoft Ignite Cloud Skills Challenge, I was issued with a free certification exam for **Exam DA-100: Analyzing Data with Microsoft Power BI**.

## Discover Data Analysis

In this module, I will explore the different roles in data and learn the different tasks of a data analyst.

#### Introduction

![DataAbundance](/assets/abundance-data-ss.png)

**Thoughts:** At work and home we get a lot of data, that is generated. From transactional data to social media.

**Notes**
At work the goal is not to overcome the challenge of understanding and using the data to positively effect change within the organization.

As Data Analysts we should be able to **tell a story with that data, unlocking its secrets**.

This can be done by developing reports that tell that story allowing the oganization to take action on that data.

The data must be accurate, in order to take advantage and be competitive, which will rely on acting on that data.

We need the ability to see metrics and clearly understand the meaning behind those metrics.

This will require working with other members who handle the data within the organization. This helps in overcoming challenges with insights on hidden values in data.

#### Overview of data analysis

![Reporting](/assets/reporting-trusted-data-ss.png)

**Thoughts** Data analysis is the process of identifying, cleaning, transforming, and modeling data to find meaningful information.

**Notes**
The reports are the storytellers that help support critical analysis.

Core components of analytics are divided into these categories below:

##### Descriptive
Descriptive analytics assist in answering questions on what happened using historical data. These provide a summary of large datasets describing outcomes.

##### Diagnostic
Diagnostic analytics answer questions of why something happened, this helps basic descriptive anayltics, by using the findings from descriptive analytics to discover the cause of those events.

 1. Identify anomalies in the data.
 2. Collect data related to those anomalies
 3. Use statistical techniques to discover relationships and trend that explain those anomalies.

##### Predictive
Predictive analytics help answer questions of what will happen in the future. It uses historical data to identify trends and determin if they will recur. Tools provide valuable insights into what can happen in the future. Predictive analytics provide a variety of statistical and amchine learning techniques such as neural networks, decision tress and regression.

##### Prescriptive
Prescriptive analytics help answer questions about what actions should be taken to achieve a goal or target. Techniques of using insights from predictive analytics and machine learning strategies to find patterns in large datasets, can help estimate different outcomes, in uncertainty to make informed decisions.

##### Cognitive
Cognitive analytics attempt to draw inferences from existing data and patterns, and derive conclusions using knowledge bases, then add these findings back into the knowledge base for future inferences, self-learning feedback loops.

Inferences are not stuctured queries based on a rules database, but they are unstructured hypotheses that are gathered from several sources and expressed with varing degrees of confidence. Effective cognitive analytics use machine learning algorithms, and will use several natural language processing concepts to make sense of previously untapped data sources, such as call center conversation logs and product reviews.

As a practice, the data analysis process will capture data from trusted sources and shape it into something that is consumable, meaningful, and easily understood to help with the decision-making process.

A data analyst knows how to organize information and distill it into something relevant and comprehensible. A data analyst knows how to gather the right data and what to do with it, in other words, making sense of the data in your data overload

#### Roles in Data

Today's applications and projects can be large and intricate, often involving the use of skills and knowledge from numerous individuals. Each person brings a unique talent and expertise, sharing in the effort of working together and coordinating tasks and responsibilities to see a project through from concept to production.

![DataRoles](/assets/roles-data-ss.png)

In the recent past, roles such as business analysts and business intelligence developers were the standard for data processing and understanding. However, excessive expansion of the size and different types of data has caused these roles to evolve into more specialized sets of skills that modernize and streamline the processes of data engineering and analysis.

##### Business analyst
A business analyst is closer to the business and is a specialist in interpreting the data that comes from the visualization.

##### Data analyst
Data analysts profile, clean, and transform data through visualization and reporting tools such as Microsoft Power BI. This includes design,build scalable and effective data models, and enable and implement the advanced analytics capabilities into reports for analysis. 

##### Data engineer
Data engineers provision and set up data platform technologies that are on-premises and in the cloud, they also manage and secure the flow of structured and unstructured data from multiple sources, such data platforms can be from relational databases, nonrelational databases, data streams, and file stores. Data engineers also ensure that data services securely and seamlessly integrate across data services.

##### Data scientist
Data scientists perform advanced analytics to extract value from data. Descriptive analytics evaluate data through a process known as exploratory data analysis (EDA).
A data scientist looks at data to determine the questions that need answers and will often devise a hypothesis or an experiment and then turn to the data analyst to assist with the data visualization and reporting.

##### Database administrator
A database administrator monitors and manages the overall health of a database and the hardware that it resides on, whereas a data engineer is involved in the process of data wrangling, in other words, ingesting, transforming, validating, and cleaning data to meet business needs and requirements.

#### Tasks of a Data Analyst

![Tasks](/assets/tasks-data-analyst-ss.png)

**Thoughts** Data Analysts assist organizations gain valuable insights in the vast datalake they have. This requires them to work with various stakeholders in an organization.

##### Prepare
Before a report can be created, data must be prepared. Data preparation is the process of profiling, cleaning, and transforming your data to get it ready to model and visualize.

##### Model
 An effective data model makes reports more accurate, allows the data to be explored faster and more efficient, decreases time for the report writing process, and simplifies future report maintenance.

##### Visualize
The ultimate goal of the visualize task is to solve business problems, by using appropriate visualizations and interactions, the data analyst can provide an effective report that guides the reader through the content quickly and efficiently, therefore allowing the reader to follow a narrative into the data.

##### Analyze
The analyze task is an important step to understand and interpret the information that is displayed on the report. A Data Analyst, should understand the analytical capabilities of Power BI and use those capabilities to find insights, identify patterns and trends, predict outcomes, and then communicate those insights in a way that everyone can understand.

##### Manage
